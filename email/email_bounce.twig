Dear {{ name }},

You have sent the attached message to our EMail forwarder, but the following
error was generated:
 "{{ error }}"

Please read the information below to help you diagnose the problem. If you are
having any problems with the forwarding system, send an email to {{ support }}
for assistance. The forwarding software is still experimental.

Best regards,
{{ signature }}

This forwarder works differently from other distribution lists you may be
familiar with which forward an email to a predetermined list of recipients. Our
forwarder looks at the name part of the "To" name field to determine whether it
should forward to a group or to a single user.

Three target variations are possible:
- Group "tag". Forward to everyone in the group defined by the group tag.
  There different types of groups with differing forwarding rules.
  Announcements may only be sent by an administrator. Also, make sure you enable
  the "receive" flag in your bookclub profile.
- Login name.  Forward to a single user with the given login name. If the login
  name contains prohibited characters, the "nicename" will be used.
- "First Last" name. Forward to the single user with the given name.

Here are some example "To" values:
 "Group 1 <{{ forwarder }}>" - Group 1 is specified, the email is distributed to
  all in that group who have opted to receive emails.
 "jdoe <{{ forwarder }}>" - The user with login "jdoe" is specified.
 "Jane Doe <{{ forwarder }}>" - Send to the user with the given first/last name
  in their WordPress profile.

The rules about who can send to a group and who will receive the group message
vary depending on the type of the group and the user settings. In general,
you should check your bookclub profile and enable the "Receive email from others"
flag if you wish to use the system.

You are welcome to resend the email if you correct the problem.
