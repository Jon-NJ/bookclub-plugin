2020-08-20  2.8.20
- Mainly this release changes how group membership is handled. Previously there
  was a fixed number of groups (four) and each one had a flag in the users
  profile record. Increasing the number of groups would require a change in the
  table as well as code changes. (Similar fields existed in some other tables,
  but they were never important and they were ignored for the plugin.) There is
  now a table (group) that defines each group and another table (groupmember) to
  handle user inclusion in the group. Two types of groups are now defined,
  normal book club groups and email lists. It is now possible to easily add and
  remove groups because they are defined in the database instead of being hard
  coded. It is no longer as easy to make a selection on multiple groups, so
  several of the pages (dates, members, events, email) had to change to use a
  single selection. There is a new menu page for managing the groups.
- Now use function require_once_folder() to automatically include sources.
- Ranking for menu sub-items so they can be automatically included in any order.
- Remove error numbers except for the sign-up page.
- Log IP address for errors.
- Sign up page no longer generates an error when no pkey is used to avoid an
  error email being sent whenever a bot scans the page.
- The "hide" button was not working in the Dates menu.
- When editing a member page, if the user has not signed up there is now a
  field for the link which can be copied to the clipboard. if the user already
  signed up, a clickable link to their WordPress profile is shown.
- Several changes to the database module:
  - Remove BookclubDatabase, use tableField, tablePrefix.
  - Changes in getColumns - automatically fetches for all tables.
  - Include ORM comments. They are not actually used.
- New email address for me - jonnj@connectberlin.de.
