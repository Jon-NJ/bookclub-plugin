**Comment** - Occasionally it is useful to add a comment to your RSVP. Perhaps you select *Maybe* and wish to add an explanation or perhaps people are being asked what they will bring to a potluck. This field is saved when you choose your RSVP and it will be shown after your name in the participant list.

### Responses - These reserve a seat (*Yes* or *Maybe*) or free a seat (*No*).

**Yes** - Choose this if you definitely plan to come. Of course you can change later and free the seat for someone on the waiting list.

**No** - Choose this if you definitely do not plan to come. Of course you can also change later if a seat is available.

**Maybe** - Choose this if you are uncertain whether you will come but you still wish to reserve a seat.

**Help** - Show this help screen.

**Download iCalendar** - Many calendar programs allow appointments to be imported using an iCalendar format file with extension name **.ics**. Normally this file should be sent along with your invitation. But if you didn't get an invitation or there is some problem with email it is possible to download this file.

**Resend invitation** - Normally you receive invitations by email. If you are on this screen you don't need the email. You may like to have it anyway so this button allows you to resend it in the event that it never arrived. Please check your settings if you are not getting any email from us.

**What** - A short description of the event.

**Where** - The address where the event is being held. There may be a clickable link for a map or online meeting.

**When** - The date and time when the meeting takes place. Obviously the end time is elastic but the start time is not. Please be prompt.

**Who** - The people who have RSVP'd to the event. Normally there will also be a maximum number of participants. Please also be aware that other participant names are obscured if you are not logged in to protect their privacy.
- **Attending** - Members who have RSVPed that they will attend.
- **Maybe** - Members who may attend, they reserve a seat but might change their mind later.
- **Not attending** - Members who will not attend.
- **Waiting** - Those who RSVP using *Yes* or *Maybe* after the maximum number of seats have been reserved will be put on a waiting list. Should someone with a reserved seat un-RSVP, there will normally be an email notification to the next in line. But it is also good to check here if you are waiting, in case the email is not received.

**Description** - A complete description of the meeting, what book will be read and where the meeting takes place.
