## State Model
The page uses three states - **Start**, **Search** and **Edit**. When one first navigates to the page, it will be in **Start** state. Various search fields are presented. Clicking the **Search** button performs a search with possible results listed below. Clicking any of the result lines will select that item and switch to **Edit** mode. But it is also possible to perform a new search. Clicking **Add** will create a new item and then transition to **Edit** mode. From this mode, the **Search** button is replaced with a **Restart** button. Clicking this button will discard any changes and revert to the **Start** mode. **Delete** is also only available in **Edit** mode. If the delete is confirmed, the item is deleted and it goes back to the **Start** state.

## Tool Buttons
- **Help** - Shows this page. Please be sure to click the close button in the top right when finished.
- **Add** - Add a new item. This button is disabled during **Edit** and may also be disabled if some of the fields are invalid.
- **Search** - Start a search based on the given parameters. Empty fields will be ignored for the search, in other words, all items will be matched.
- **Restart** - *Only visible in **Edit** mode.* Changes are discarded, return to **Start** mode.
- **Save** - *Only enabled in **Edit** mode.* Changes will be saved. If the button is disabled in edit mode, it indicates that some field is invalid or that saving is not necessary (e.g. nothing has changed).
- **Delete** - *Only enabled in **Edit** mode.* The item will be removed from the database. There is a sanity check - an author cannot be removed if there are books with this author in the database.

## Search/Edit fields
- **Author ID** - Unique identifier for this author (read only in edit mode).
- **Name** - Name of the author. Existing authors should be available as drop down suggestions.
- **Link** - Optional URL for the author, their own web site or a wiki link.
- **Bio** - Short HTML formatted biography.

## Search Results
