### Disclaimer
The software is still in development. Please report any problems to your [site administrator](mailto:{{ support }}) ({{ support }}).

### Privacy
The CMS software used on this site is WordPress. It is free and open source.

Your information is kept in a database on this server. It is not shared with WordPress or any other organization. We wish to keep it as private as possible.

Administrators for the site can see all the information except the password. Other users should not see anything except your name, and then they will only see it if you RSVP to an event.

We expect you to use a real name because you will be meeting people in real life and meeting in people's homes who have a right to know whom they are inviting.

**Wordpress account name** - This is the name you will be logging in with. You can mix upper/lower case and numbers, but spaces should not be used. There is no mechanism to change the name after the account is created. Don't use your real full name, but you could combine your first name with a last initial or perhaps you have an account name you use for Twitter or other web sites.

**First name** - First name | given name | forename or nickname.

**Last name** - Last name | family name | surname.

**Your E-Mail** - EMail address you wish to use for receiving the invitations. It is possible to disable the Book Club software from sending you email using a flag in your Book Club profile. But if you forget your password, the WordPress software should be able to send you a link to reset it.

**Password** - Please select a password that will not be hacked - for your protection and ours. The password will be encrypted in the database. We won't know what it is, so make sure you keep track of it. Recommended guidelines:
- Minimum eight characters.
- Mix lower- and uppercase letters, digits and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words.
- Use a password that is unique for this site.
- Use a password locker if you have one and let it create a password for you.

## Create Account
The information will be validated to some extent and a WordPress account will be created. Any future changes should be made by logging in with your account name and password.

## Remove all data
For those who have requested a new account, the request contains the data shown above. If you change your mind about joining, you can remove the request from our database. For existing users migrating to WordPress, this will also remove your account. Use this option with caution.
